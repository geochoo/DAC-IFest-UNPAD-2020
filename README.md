<h1 style="color: #5e9ca0;">Data Analysis Competition IFest UNPAD 2020</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">Impression:</h2>
<p>This is my first ever joining a data analysis competition and it was surprising yet memorable. In this competition, I worked together with Jessica Xaviera and Natasya Gloria Rajagukguk, formed a team named "High Hopes". We were last year student in Politeknik Keuangan Negara STAN, majoring in Tax.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 style="color: #2e6c80;">How we worked:</h2>
<ul>
<li>First, we did a preliminary stage for 9 days in total. The program used in this stage was SQL. We worked out the thing and finished the stage in 4 days. We achieved Top 5 and proceed to the final stage</li>
<li>First day of final stage, we had to do the analysis and make a presentation file in just 4 hours. The tools we used are SQL, Python, and Ms. Excel. The task was identifying the customer segmentation of a marketplace and give a recommendation for each customer category we make.</li>
<li>Most of teams actually went with clustering the data (e.g. K-means algorithm) while we basically just did exploratory data analysis (EDA).</li>
<li>Here is the reason: We thought the dataset given was more focused on the product and didn't have enough feature to represent what we want the best. We want to make a segmentation on the loyalty of the customer of the store. How much they had spent, how many times they made the order, etc.</li>
<li>Second day of final stage, we delivered a presentation in front of judges. We thought what makes us first winner was when we mentioned about the potential business process weakness and sucessfully explained the problem when one of the judges asked us.</li>
<li>Here was the thought: Based on our label, most of customers were still in low-value customer category. However, only small percentage who was one-time buyer. This showed the interest of the customer with the store but something went wrong. The lenght of transaction was pretty long. There was an uncertainty because of maximum transaction length. Based on general knowledge, customer wants faster process of their order. The failed orders by 0.84% of total customers could make up 13% of the total revenue. This large volume of potential order shows potential disatisfication of high-value customer wannabe. This opinion was also supported by the fact only &lt;1% of the customers were high-value customers.</li>
</ul>
